## Planetary Orbit Calculation
A Java program that computes the orbital distance and velocity of a planet given the mass of its parent star and its orbital period, using [Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion). 

### How to Run

To run the program, execute the following command in the directory where the ```.jar``` file resides:

```> java -jar GUI.jar```

This should launch the program. Follow the on-screen instructons to continue. 

### Sample Usage 

In the following example, we compute the orbital distance of a planet whose period is 0.82 years (~300 days) and parent star three times as massive as the Sun:

**Note:** AU stands for *Astronomical Unit* and is the average distance of the Earth from the Sun, equivalent to about 150 million kilometers (~93 million miles).
